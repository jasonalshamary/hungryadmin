Welcome to my blog, my name is Forrest, and today I'll be your guide to
reading information about me. I've been working in the world of Linux for
approximately four years now. I'm a big fan of automation, and Python is by
far my favorite scripting language. in my free time I contribute to
open-source projects, hike, practice yoga, and play the electric bass.
