:slug: About Me

Welcome to my blog, my name is Forrest (you can catch me on IRC at the same)
and I've been working in the world of Linux for approximately six years now.
I'm a big fan of automation, Python, and improving myself. in my free time I
contribute to open-source projects, hike, practice yoga, and play the
electric bass.
