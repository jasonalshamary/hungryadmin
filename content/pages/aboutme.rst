:slug: About Me

Welcome to my blog, my name is Forrest and I've been working in the world of
Linux for approximately eight years now. I'm a big fan of automation, Python,
and improving myself. in my free time I contribute to open-source projects,
hike, lift, practice yoga, and play the electric bass.
