Book Reviews - January
======================
:date: 2018-02-02
:tags: books

I've been trying to read more recently and finished about 18 books last year.
I am aiming for 4 books a month this year. I figured I might as well do a
quick review of what I've been reading and only made it through 3 books in
January unfortunately. I'm not going to include technical books
related to my job here as those can justify their own full reviews in most
cases.

How To REMEMBER PEOPLE'S NAMES
------------------------------

This was the first book I read in 2018 as I've noticed this is a failing I
have and in my goal to become a more well rounded individual it seemed like an
easy area to improve. Several common sense techniques were discussed but a few
related to memorization and characterization I was unfamiliar with and I've
been using these to remember the names of people I meet more easily. Overall
this was definitely worth the time it took to read and perform the included
exercises.

Artemis
-------

The follow up from Andy Weir after his very enjoyable book The Martian
was only okay. It felt like a book written for an eventual movie deal and
the characters were much more one dimensional and immature than his previous
book. There was still some hard science, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much
due to the immaturity of the main character and huge amount of tense scenarios
that felt like overkill. A bit of a let down after The Martian.

Oathbringer - Book 3 of The Stormlight Archive
----------------------------------------------

I've listened to the previous two as audio books and did the same for this one.
At nearly 45 hours at 1x speed (I listen at 1.5x) this was definitely some work
to get through but was immensely enjoyable and I look forward to the next book
when it comes out in 2020. I'm not a huge fantasy fan but these really do it
for me and the characters are excellent. I cried, I laughed, and my imagination
was driven wild with the visuals my brain was able to conjure thanks to the
words in this masterpiece of literature. So descriptive and enthralling that
I spent over 12 hours listening to the audio book in a single weekend. If that
doesn't say something then I don't know what does.
