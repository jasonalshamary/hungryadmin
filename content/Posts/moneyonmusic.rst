A year later, spending $15 a month on music still rules

Last year around this time I decided that I would start buying music regularly
from Bandcamp.com instead of using subscription services. I had bought
music sporadically previously but realized it was time to start supporting
the artists I care about more regularly. Subscription services don't
benefit many of the people I like to the extent that an album purchase
does thus I decided to start purchasing albums. So instead of being able to
listen to everything I decided to give myself ~$15 USD every month to buy
music with.

I've found this method to be extremely satisfying as I need to be selective
about what I buy. It also helps me regularly find fantastic new music as I
check several times a week for new releases that I can add to my wishlist. I
make purchases once a month (minus a podcast here and there) which ensures
that I'm not overspending regularly and that I make hard decisions regarding
what I really want to listen to. I've found that making these difficult
decisions for what truly stands out to me each month is much more satisfying
for the space I am in mentally. Every month the albums I purchase directly
reflect the space and mood I'm currently in. I've found myself continually
going back to certain genres and artists month after month to support them
even though there are other fantastic releases so the trend there is
interesting to see.

The main downside to this process has been that my wishlist of music grows
far faster than my purchasing budget allows. This means I still have releases
that I would like to own but am not currently feeling as much as others on
my wishlist from as far back as two years. Even with this minor downside I'm
still very pleased with the experience thus far, and I also realize that $15 a
month is how much many people spend on coffee in a week so it's fairly low
budget wise. The point with my budget was to try and bring it down to a
competitive level with many streaming services. I also have the
enjoyable side effect that I own all of this music and can easily move it
between machines, plus most artists are offering MP3 320, or FLAC so the
quality is generally outstanding (quality issues arise more from mixing
problems at this than anything else).

After using this purchase process for the past year I've decided I'm going to
continue with it. In the end I am more satisfied with my purchases, I get to
support artists directly, and I enjoy a much more tightly curated music
library.
