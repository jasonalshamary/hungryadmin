Book Reviews - March
=======================

In March I finished 5 books and met my goal. Part of this was sticking to my
rule that if I'm not pulled in by the 50th page I put it down and move on,
and part of it was simply selecting better books. I also read one book that
I ended up putting down which I will include here.

The Three-Body Problem
----------------------

Probably my favorite book of March this was an excellent science fiction
novel based on present day. One of the interesting aspects that made this
book quite a bit different was the fact the book was set in China and written
by a Chinese author so there was a history lesson about the cultural
revolution in China as well as a different style of writing and a noticeable
change in narrative structure. Combining that with a really interesting and
rewarding story made this a great read and I finished it in just a few days.

The Ghost Brigades
------------------

Another Scalzi novel in an established universe I know I like, this was a
fun but casual action packed sci-fi romp. I don't really know what to say
past that. It was enjoyable and I found the story to be interesting and
universe expanding which is always nice.


All Systems Red
---------------

This was by far my least favorite book for the month. More of a novella than
anything else while the overall story was interesting, there were some
annoying grammar usage and word repetition that kept popping up that really
distracted me. I finished it but I was glad to be done as these noticeable
short comings in the writing got worse as the book went on.

Edgedancer
---------------

I listened to the audio book version of Edgedancer and really enjoyed it. The
look into Lift's character and where she was between Words of Radiance and
Oathbringer was well thought out. It expanded her character in interesting
ways while staying on track and putting you in a good spot for seeing her
again in Oathbringer. I would definitely recommend people listen to or read
Edgedancer before Oathbringer and I wish I had known about it as I would have
done so.

We Are Legion (We Are Bob)
--------------------------

An interesting take on cryogenics and where it might lead tied in with a
sci-fi plot of digital cloning and expansion. I enjoyed this more towards the
beginning than where it progressed to later in the book. I probably won't read
the second in the series but it wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't to my tastes
after some time.

The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O
----------------------------

The second book written by Neal Stephenson that I didn't finished and I won't
read anything he writes going forward if the page count is over 500. This is
the second novel of his I've tried to read (I tried reading Anathem last year)
and I just can't stand how he disrespects the reader's time. Everything in
this book is plodding, slow, and I was constantly in a state of thinking to
myself "okay I get it we can move on". This is especially disappointing as the
opening to the book is decent but from there it was all downhill for the next
80 or so pages I read (breaking my own 50 page rule, but at least it was only
80).
