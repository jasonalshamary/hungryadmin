Book Reviews - April
=======================

I would consider April a total failure for reading. At the beginning of the
month I decided I wanted to try and focus on more self improvement and
reflection style books, but hadn't checked many of these out on time, and
wasn't very motivated to read. I only finished one book and got most of the
way through a second.


The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up
-------------------------------------

One of the weirder books I've ever read, it talks about keeping your living
space clean, organizing it, etc. I was hoping to get something out of this book
and the biggest thing was just throwing away some boxes I don't really need
any more. Past that there was far too much of a spiritual aspect to this book
and it felt weird to me. Overall the book had a few good take aways but
if you're keeping your place clean and organized, not hoarding items
and generally picking up after yourself I don't feel it can improve on much
that you're doing. This one was only okay and the spiritual aspect to tidying
was simply too much for me.

Meditations 
-----------

A book by Marcus Aurelius that goes into some portions of stoicism, I don't
have a ton left in this book but am moving through it very slowly. The book
isn't written like a novel but simply journal entries, and even at that they
are quite terse so it's been slow going. Some of the information is worthwhile
but much of it simply boils down to being a good person every day which I
already strive to do. I hope to finish it this month.
