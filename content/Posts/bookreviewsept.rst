Book Reviews - September
========================

:tags: books

I was really busy with job interviews in September (will save that for another
post) so I only managed to make it through two books this month. Like I noted
last month it didn't help that I did a poor job managing my queue from the
library. The books that I did finish I read in only a few days each so the
passion to read is still there ten months after starting this which is good
to know.

Iron Gold
---------

This is the first in a new series continuing the universe in the "Red Rising"
trilogy. I've read the first three books and enjoyed them quite a bit. Iron
Gold wasn't quite as enjoyable and I think a lot of that had to do with the
idea of so many stories going on at the same time. The book follows 4
different individuals where some stories are entwined and others are not.
While the narrative wasn't too disjointed it also didn't create the same kind
of connection with the characters and drive to really plow through the book
because you are constantly wondering what happens next. It also ended on a bit
of a cliff hanger which is a personal pet peeve for me. I understand it's a
continuing story, but I don't see why books need to have cliffhangers, it
just seems pointless and kind of cheap execution wise. Overall a pretty
enjoyable read that doesn't capture the magic of the original trilogy though
I'll probably read the next book whenever it's out.

Lock In
-------

A relatively short (about 300 pages, so only a few hours to read through)
near-future novel that I really enjoyed. It has some fun tech/IT related ideas
that make sense in the universe even though they have a somewhat sci-fi bend.
The characters and story are pretty interesting and while it is self contained
it has the set up for more novels in the universe (and I've already put the
second on hold). It falls more into a mystery/thriller style than some of the
other books I've read recently but I found the story to be a page turner and
the characters to be interesting and well written in their humanity. I
finished the whole thing in less than 24 hours which is a very good sign to me
in terms of how interesting ri find the content. I'd definitely recommend Lock
In for those who like John Scalzi and won't talk about too many more details
for fear of spoiling the book.
