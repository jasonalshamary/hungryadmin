Mission vs Money vs Ethics

Since I was let go from my job I’ve been back on the job hunt. My goals over
the last few years have had a pretty simply motto, make as much money as I
can as ethically as I can. This means that I’m not willing to work in certain
industries, or for specific companies. It’s important that I can wake up every
day and see myself as creating something worthwhile, even if it’s not a game
changer. In the past few weeks I’ve gotten to final discussions with a few
companies regarding salary, or getting the last of my questions answered when
it came to a questionable organization. I decided it was time to write a
little bit about this because it’s been a struggle. Constantly interviewing
with companies sucks, but working for somewhere that is ethically questionable
sucks even more.

As this post is titled it’s recently come down to a few things, the mission of
the organization, the money they offer, and the ethics of what they do.
Sometimes the mission is there, but the money isn’t, and sometimes they have
the money, but I can’t ethically work there because of what they do (military
contractors, some banks, companies like Comcast, etc.)

A few weeks ago I finished my final interview with an awesome non-profit. I
was excited about what they were doing and the potential impact I could have.
I had already talked to the CEO once and brought up my concerns over salary in
the non-profit space and he assured me that they paid competitively and
fairly. When the CEO called and let me know that I was their first choice and
people were excited to work with me I was ecstatic as I was looking forward to
working with them as well. Their mission was cool, and I’ve been hoping to
work for an organization doing good for quite some time. Then came the
discussion about money. I was hopeful as we had previously talked about
how they were competitive. The CEO explained their benefits to me, how they
were willing to be flexible depending on people’s needs and so forth. All
great things to hear. Then he asked about my salary range, and I provided it
and it was lower than my typical range would be as I was willing to sacrifice
a bit of money because of the mission.

This was when the disappointment set in. He explained the situation, the fact
they were a non-profit and couldn’t offer west coast style salaries (my
range was pretty generous in this regard plus their finances are public so I
knew it wasn't outside the realm of what was realistic). I was also told that
the previous employee in this position had been making a lot less than what I
provided as a reasonable salary while also living on the west
coast. I was pretty gutted after hearing this. We ended the call a few minutes
later, and he emailed me a while after that letting me know they couldn’t
afford the salary I was asking for so we never made it to the actual offer
stage. This lead me to question what I am willing to sacrifice salary wise for
the mission and I realized it’s some, but it’s not that much. Sacrificing
somewhere around 50% - 60% of my old salary just wasn’t something I was
willing to do. Even if the mission is great organizations have to realize that
they have to pay well if they want to retain passionate talent. Paying poor
salaries creates resentment among workers and it just means people are going
to move on relatively quickly. Delaying retirement by an extra 5-15 years
because you took a lower salary isn’t going to fly with a lot of people. It
certainly isn’t going to fly for me no matter how important the mission of
the organization is.

The mission is important, but the money has to be there.

I also declined to continue the negotiation and interview process with a
startup over ethical issues. I had been on the fence due to the questionable
organizations they allowed to use their product but after talking to their
CEO I knew the company was not for me. The CEO explained that they would
allow organizations such as the KKK to use their platform and I simply
couldn’t support this sort of behavior. They explained that
“inciting violence” was the key tenant of their terms of service, but in my
mind, how can an organization like the KKK be allowed to use their services
while that policy is in place considering they are an organization built on
violence and hate?

Hearing this plus my previous trepidation meant I was completely
disinterested. I can’t imagine waking up at 2 in the morning to potentially
protect the KKK from a DDOS, or helping them ensure that their newsletters get
sent out. How could I look at myself every morning knowing I’m potentially
helping spread the message of organizations built on hatred and racism? The
money was decent and the benefits were okay, but the ethics just weren’t there
and I don’t understand how anyone who currently works there could continue
doing so knowing they would allow such an organization to use their services
or how they could be okay with having that sort of customer. I couldn’t work
there and I couldn’t live with myself if I did so I had to let the hiring
manager know that I wasn’t interested in going any further with this
organization.

The money can be there, but without meeting my ethical standards it’s
pointless.

At the end of the day I’m still unemployed after getting to the final process
with these recent organizations. While I’m disappointed I’m also glad that I
can stay objective enough, and ethically just enough to decline offers which
would make me question myself every day. I might not have a paycheck, but I
haven’t compromised my personal needs or my personal beliefs and that’s what
really matters to me in the long term.
