Book Reviews - May
=======================

I only finished two books in May due to being busy in my personal life, but am
satisfied with what I read. Hopefully June will be more productive as I have a
few shorter books in my queue, but there's also a few longer ones. I also need
to make sure I keep up on placing holds from the library in the event a book
is in high demand.


Man's Search For Meaning
------------------------

This was a book I've been wanting to read for a while. It talks about a man's
experience during the Holocaust as someone who lived through it as a prisoner
in various camps controlled by Germany during the time period. The first half
of the book was pretty interesting and talked about his experience day to day
as well as how he managed to survive and his mental state. I enjoyed the first
half a lot, but didn't like the second half at all. The second half goes into
a specific type of therapy and really sounded like a sales pitch or
advertisement for this type of therapy. Worth reading, but ignore the second
half completely.

The Dark Forest
---------------

Book two of The Three Body Problem trilogy. I found this one to be enjoyable
but didn't progress as quickly as the first and found some points in the
story to be a bit of a slog. I'm not sure if this was due to the translation
or simply the contents but many plot points were drawn out and the dialogue
was stiff. I'll definitely read the third book but I'm going to need to
take a bit of a break from this series before I do that.
