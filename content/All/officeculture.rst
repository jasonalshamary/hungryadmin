What is Office Culture?
=======================

I've been interviewing with a good number of companies over the past few months
since I quit my job and there's one take on a phrase that I keep hearing and
have yet to understand: 'We want you in the office to help build our office
culture', 'We are looking for someone to foster an office culture', 'we need
someone who can personify our office culture'. These phrases are extremely
confusing to me, what is office culture? What is it you are trying to foster?

To begin with I reviewed a good number of articles on what office culture is.
Some of them discussed having a team that feels purpose and a sense of
direction, while others talked about values and goals along with creating
work environments that are fun. Still others discussed instilling a sense of
respect and open communication in your employees. Overall there didn't seem
to be a cohesive idea with office culture, and that's probably my biggest
issue with it.

In many cases the office culture seems to be dictated by a C level exec,
or driven by people who would prefer to speak in person (HR, recruiters,
project managers, etc.). There's also something to be said for face to
face communication as it builds connections between team members. This
interaction is something that can be beneficial to your team, but is
it something that needs to happen ever day? Does it even happen every
day when people go to the office? I know in the past when I've worked
in offices that many times we didn't speak face to face about work all day.
Most conversation that didn't happen in a chat, email, or on a PR was
limited to off-topic chatter.

Do you really need an office culture?
-------------------------------------

This brings up the question that I ask myself every time I do one of these
interviews, why do these people care so much about office culture? Is the
culture of your office supposed to dictate whether people are moral or not?
Does the culture somehow enforce how people are supposed to act instead of
simply behaving appropriately? I'm not sure. It seems to me in many cases
that office culture is meant to achieve a few goals. The first of these is
as a scapegoat for acting against an employee that is creating issues for
other employees. It's much easier to simply say 'WELL THIS IS OUR CULTURE'
than improve things, something that is especially problematic with company
founders and C level executives that believe their vision is the only vision
(hint, these are places you don't want
to work). The idea of office culture is also often used to force people to work
more than 40 hours a week. Whether it's through guilting people into working
later to be a team player, or simply saying that overtime is part of the
culture of the business, it's still a negative culture trait.

When I look back at places I've worked, I would not consider any office culture
to be one that I would recognize to have been a positive experience. There were
sects within the organization who genuinely wanted to foster growth and
improvement, but these were generally operating in the shadows or within a
small group of dedicated individuals fighting back against the stupidity that
their office culture had become. Shunning improvement within the organization
instead of dealing with the issues head on was a common occurrence and many
times it related to the office culture that had existed.

Having a defined office culture never seems like something that really matters.
There's the real office culture, and then the advertised office culture, and
I've found the advertisement rarely reflects what the culture is truly like. It
seems like more reflection is what's really needed regarding the true culture
and what problems exist. Sadly many of the people in charge of improving that
culture don't seem to care about doing this.

The thing I've realized about office culture is that it doesn't matter
what I think about the culture. What's important is having a page on your
company website where investors can see what the imaginary culture looks like.
Office culture isn't something that's cultivated by employees, it's something
many employees have to work around. Most of the people who implemented or
helped foster the culture of the office are either no longer doing day to day
'work', or have moved on from the company leaving behind their positive or
negative contributions.

Positively affecting office culture
-----------------------------------

So this lead me to question how to positively affect office culture since the
idea isn't going away. How can you foster a culture that needs to grow, or
impact an existing one in a positive way? It really starts with you as an
individual, you have to demonstrate the kind of culture you want to be part of.
It's hard to do but it's something that you have to reflect. At that point
either other people will start getting on board (creating the sect I spoke of
earlier), or they won't and it's time to go elsewhere. If a company can't
realistically grow and develop their culture due to some bad apples or stubborn
C level executives then how can they continue to grow and evolve as an
organization?
