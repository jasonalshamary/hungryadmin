Writing and Launching My First Book
===================================

Today I launched my first short book (https://gumroad.com/l/nZdiH) aimed at
helping IT Recruiters become better at interacting with members of the IT
community. I'm hoping that this field manual can help recruiters quickly
become more familiar with what people in IT want to see when they're contacted
and what these interactions should look like. We all have our issues with how
recruiters approach the IT space so a short book that gets
straight to the point was something I felt was missing. It helps that I'm
not selling a service so there's no spin trying to get people to buy other
products.

I was a bit worried about the length of the book versus the price but after
reviewing the average profit a recruiter makes I figure if they even have one
positive interaction then it has paid for the book a dozen times over. If 
you know a recruiter that could use some help I'm currently discounting the
book from $4.99 to $3.99 as the minimum purchase price if you use the code:
'blogdollar'.
